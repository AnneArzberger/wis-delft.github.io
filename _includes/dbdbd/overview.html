                    <p> The Dutch-Belgian DataBase Day (DBDBD) is a yearly one-day workshop, organized in a Belgian or
                        Dutch university, whose general topic is database research.
                        DBDBD 2021 will be held in Delft, The Netherlands. Due to the cooperation between SIKS and the
                        local organisation of DBDBD, registration for SIKS-members is free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At DBDBD 2021, junior and senior researchers from the Netherlands and Belgium can present their
                        recent results, and meet senior researchers in the field of data management.
                        It is an excellent opportunity to meet up with your Belgian/Dutch colleagues, and to get
                        informed about the (recent) database-related research performed in Belgian/Dutch universities.
                        The workshop welcomes non-Belgian/Dutch participants (presentations are in English).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The workshop consists of oral and poster presentations. There are no printed proceedings.
                        Abstracts of oral and poster presentations will be published on the DBDBD 2021 website.
                    </p>
