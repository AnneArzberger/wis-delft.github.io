                    <p> The Dutch-Belgian DataBase Day (DBDBD) is a yearly one-day workshop, organized in a Belgian or
                        Dutch university, whose general topic is database research.
                        DBDBD 2021 will be held <del> in Delft, The Netherlands </del>  online. Due to the cooperation between SIKS and the
                        local organisation of DBDBD, registration for SIKS-members is free.

                    <p>
                        At DBDBD 2021, junior and senior researchers from the Netherlands and Belgium can present their
                        recent results, and meet senior researchers in the field of data management.
                        It is an excellent opportunity to meet up with your Belgian/Dutch colleagues, and to get
                        informed about the (recent) database-related research performed in Belgian/Dutch universities.

                        Abstracts of oral and poster presentations will be published on the DBDBD 2021 website.

                        One of the core goals of DBDBD is to get to know your fellow database researchers better. To make this easier,
                        we will have a new special session this year: the <em>Who-is-Who-Session</em>. For this session, we kindly ask <em>every group</em> in The Netherlands or Belgium who participating at DBDBD to prepare a very brief presentation (5 slides max). In order to contribute to this session, there will be a special track in the EasyChair submission system
                        where you can signal your willingness.
