                        <h5 class="padding-bottom-1">Jyoti Leeka, Senior Research Scientist, Microsoft Research</h5>
                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> Query optimization is a critical technology needed by all modern
                            data processing systems. However, it is traditionally implemented in silos and is deeply
                            embedded in different systems. Furthermore, over the years, query optimizers have become
                            less understood and rarely touched pieces of code that are brittle to changes and very
                            expensive to maintain, thus slowing down the pace of innovation. In this talk, I will argue
                            that it is time to design query optimizer as a service in modern cloud architectures. Such a
                            design will help build a set of well-maintained optimizations that are externalized from the
                            query engines and that could be learned (and improved) using the large workloads present in
                            modern clouds. I will present a reference architecture for our query optimizer as a service,
                            explaining details of intra-query and inter-query optimizations performed. A key enabler for
                            the externalization of intra-query optimization is the plethora of recent machine
                            learning-based techniques developed to improve query optimizer components, such as
                            cardinality, cost model, and query planner. On the other hand, externalization of
                            inter-query optimization, also known as multi-query optimization, is motivated by numerous
                            efforts on view materialization, physical layouts (i.e., partitioning, etc.), and most
                            recently by Pipemizer, a data pipeline-aware optimization effort at Microsoft. Finally, I
                            will describe our success in deploying the early version of query optimizer as a service in
                            Cosmos at Microsoft.</p>

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> Despite their impressive performance, machine learning systems
                            remain prohibitively unreliable in safety-, trust-, and ethically sensitive domains. Recent
                            discussions in different sub-fields of AI have reached the consensus of knowledge need in
                            machine learning; few discussions have touched upon the diagnosis of what knowledge is
                            needed. In this talk, I will present our ongoing work on ARCH, a knowledge-driven,
                            human-centered, and reasoning-based tool, for diagnosing the unknowns of a machine learning
                            system. ARCH leverages human intelligence to create domain knowledge required for a given
                            task and to describe the internal behavior of a machine learning system; it infers the
                            missing or incorrect knowledge of the system with the built-in probabilistic, abductive
                            reasoning engine. ARCH is a generic tool that can be applied to machine learning in
                            different contexts. In the talk, I will present several applications and domains in which
                            ARCH is currently being developed and tested, including health, finance, and transport.</p>
