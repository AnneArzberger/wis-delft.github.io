                        <p><strong>Martin Grohe</strong> is a computer scientist known for his research on parameterized
                            complexity,
                            mathematical logic, finite model theory, the logic of graphs, database theory, and
                            descriptive complexity theory. He is a University Professor of Computer Science at RWTH
                            Aachen University, where he holds the Chair for Logic and Theory of Discrete Systems.
                            Grohe won the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Prize awarded by the German Research Foundation in
                            1999. He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2017 for "contributions to logic in computer
                            science, database theory, algorithms, and computational complexity".</p>
