                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong>Vector representations of graphs and relational data, whether
                            hand-crafted feature vectors or learned representations, enable us to apply standard data
                            analysis and machine learning techniques to these forms of structured data. A wide range of
                            methods for generating such vector embeddings has been studied in the machine learning and
                            knowledge representation literature. However, vector embeddings have received relatively
                            little attention from a theoretical point of view.</p>

                        <p>The first part of my talk will be devoted to embedding algorithms in practice. Starting with
                            a brief overview of common embedding techniques, I will speak about a new embedding
                            algorithm for dynamically changing relational data. In the second part of my talk, I will
                            discuss theoretical ideas that have proved useful for analysing and designing vector
                            embeddings and that may help us to develop a more principled view on the area.</p>

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> It is increasingly recognized that data is a central challenge for
                            AI systems - whether training an entirely new model, discovering data for a model, or
                            applying an existing model to new data. Given this centrality of data, there is need to
                            provide new tools that are able to help data teams create, curate and debug datasets in the
                            context of complex machine learning pipelines. In this talk, I outline the underlying
                            challenges for data debugging and curation in these environments. I then discuss our recent
                            research that both takes advantage of ML to improve datasets but also uses core database
                            techniques for debugging in such complex ML pipelines.</p>

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> Modern database systems have been progressively expanding their use cases far outside traditional bookkeeping 
                            and data analytics, and into artificial intelligence workloads like machine learning and mathematical optimization. This in turn motivates 
                            the need for native in-database automatic differentiation to better support these use cases.

                            In this talk, we present RelationalAD (RAD), our framework for automatic differentiation at RelationalAI (RAI). 
                            Rel, the modeling language underlying RelationalAI, is declarative and can be viewed as a generalization of Datalog 
                            with infinite relations (e.g. arithmetic), aggregation, and relational abstraction. The input to RAD is a Rel program 
                            that defines a (set of) relational views and the output is another Rel program that defines new views that are the derivatives 
                            with respect to some given input relations. We show that performing AutoDiff inside a high-level database language like Rel 
                            allows us to evaluate derivatives while enjoying many features offered by the underlying database engine like factorization, 
                            query optimization and compilation, as well as support for higher-order derivatives. We present several examples covering 
                            recursive Rel programs, matrix calculus, neural network training, and gradient descent among others. We conclude with some challenges, 
                            design issues, as well as open problems.</p>

                        <p><strong>ABSTRACT.</strong> Despite their impressive performance, machine learning systems
                            remain prohibitively unreliable in safety-, trust-, and ethically sensitive domains. Recent
                            discussions in different sub-fields of AI have reached the consensus of knowledge need in
                            machine learning; few discussions have touched upon the diagnosis of what knowledge is
                            needed. In this talk, I will present our ongoing work on ARCH, a knowledge-driven,
                            human-centered, and reasoning-based tool, for diagnosing the unknowns of a machine learning
                            system. ARCH leverages human intelligence to create domain knowledge required for a given
                            task and to describe the internal behavior of a machine learning system; it infers the
                            missing or incorrect knowledge of the system with the built-in probabilistic, abductive
                            reasoning engine. ARCH is a generic tool that can be applied to machine learning in
                            different contexts. In the talk, I will present several applications and domains in which
                            ARCH is currently being developed and tested, including health, finance, and transport.</p>
