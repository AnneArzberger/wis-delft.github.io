                        We focus on core IR topics such as collaborative search, conversational search and data-hungry ranking models.
                        We also focus on the application of IR to various domains, most prominently the educational domain.

                      Web search engines are today considered to be the primary tool to assist and empower learners in finding information relevant 
                        to their learning goals - be it learning something new, improving their existing skills, or just fulfilling a curiosity. 
                        Search engines though are not optimized for human learning; instead they are optimized for the retrieval of information.
                        What users do with the information or how they use it during their learning is not considered. In this research line
                        we focus on exactly that issue: how to design search engine components (on the interface level or the ranking level)
                        that are optimized for human learning.
                        
                        One concrete example of this research line is our work on instructional scaffolding: a traditional learning support 
                        strategy that has been studied in the traditional educational context but not incorporated as an element in search systems.
