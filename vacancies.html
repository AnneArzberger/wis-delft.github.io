                    <p>We are seeking motivated individuals interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science.
                        Ideal candidates would have a MSc degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or a related field, be broadly interested in Human Computation and Crowdsourcing,
                        and in building hybrid human-machine systems to tackle problems of societal importance.
                        We aim to attract multiple PhD candidates in the Crowd Computing team headed by
                        <a href="http://yangjiera.github.io/" target="_blank">Jie Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.ujwalgadiraju.com/" target="_blank">Ujwal Gadiraju</a>

                    <p>Crowd computing involves algorithmic engagement and coordination of people by means of Web-enabled platforms.
                        These complex tasks are mainly focused on the creation, enrichment, and interpretation of data, making crowd
                        computing a building block of data science: from

                        all major companies employ crowd computing to fulfil their data needs, both by involving employees, and by reaching out
                        to anonymous crowds through online marketplaces like Amazon Mechanical Turk. The Crowd Computing team will focus on leveraging
                        human intelligence in combination with machines to solve important problems that breach multiple disciplines including Machine Learning,
                        Information Retrieval, Computer Vision and NLP.
