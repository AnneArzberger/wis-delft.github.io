## About 

Tahir Abbas is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Web Information Systems group, at Delft University of Technology. His research interests include Conversational User Interfaces (CUI), (real-time) Human Computation (HCOMP), Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). He holds a degree in software engineering and previously worked as a lecturer in a public sector university in Pakistan, where he taught a variety of subjects, including HCI, Programming, Software Design, and Quality Assurance.

He is currently working with [Ujwal Gadiraju](https://ujwalgadiraju.com) on the 4TU.CEE project â€“ [UNCAGE](https://www.uncage.info), with the ultimate goal of leveraging CUI to address students' academic and emotional needs. More precisely, he is examining how CUI may be used to aid university students in establishing and monitoring their academic goals, as a daily diary technique for gaining real-time insight into adolescents' well-being, and to aid university students in overcoming certain mental health challenges.

During his PhD studies at the Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e) led by Panos Markopoulos, he worked on crowd-powered conversational systems (CPCS). More precisely, he studied how can we improve the effectiveness of CPCS by investigating technological and performance measures for enabling real-time HCOMP for embodied conversational systems, as well as addressing response latency and response quality issues in CPCS using well-established theories of time perception and psychology.
