## About
I am Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl) (WIS) group in [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl). I co-lead the [Kappa](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/crowd-computing) research line on Crowd Computing & Human-Centered AI at the WIS group and the Delft AI Lab [Design@Scale](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab) in the university. Before, I was a machine learning scientist at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science), based in Seattle, and a senior researcher at the [eXascale Infolab](https://exascale.info), University of Fribourg - Switzerland. I received my PhD from TU Delft in 2017, MSc from TU Eindhoven in 2013, and BEng from Zhejiang University in 2011. During my master program, I also spent some time at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home).

I work on *human-in-the-loop* approaches for reliable and trustworthy machine learning. The underlying assumption is that to create AI that really serves the purpose of people, it is of key importance to involve stakeholders in the design and development of new technologies for every stage of the machine learning lifecycle. My [research](https://yangjiera.github.io/project.html) contributes a new set of human-in-the-loop methods and tools for the development and evaluation of, and the interaction with, machine learning systems. With such efforts, my utimate goal is to transform machine learning into an engineering discipline that gives humans the full control of AI such that it can be reliably and safely used in all kinds of contexts. 

My research methodology is both empirical and theoretical, with primary activities characterized by the design, implementation, and analysis of human studies, computational algorithms, and human-in-the-loop systems. I particularly value the collaboration with scientists from other disciplines and experts from various application domains, together with whom me and my [research team](https://yangjiera.github.io/people.html) develop usable tools to make real-world impact.
