## About
I am PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group at TU Delft under the supervision of Jie Yang. I hold a M.Sc. and B.Sc. degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Politecnico di Milano where, prior to moving to Delft, I also worked for two years. My research is focused on the use of Human-in-the-Loop approaches to inspect NLP Language Models with the final aim of improving their robustness.
