## About
I am a PhD candidate interested in Explainable Machine Learning models in general with a focus on ranking models in IR. My adviser is Prof. Avishek Anand. My research goal is to understand complex ranking models particularly the ones assisted by large pre-training language models, and taking a further attempt to make the ranking models intrinsically transparent.

I obtained my MSc degree in computer science from Leibniz University Hannover, Germany, and BSc degree from Jinan University in Guangzhou, China.
