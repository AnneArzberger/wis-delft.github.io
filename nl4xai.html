        <h3>Learning to design robust natural language generation models for explainable AI</h3>

        <img src="assets/img/NL4XAI/NL4XAI spring school.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 5px;" width="100%" />

        <p><em>On the 19th of April, scientists from different countries will meet with big tech companies such as Google and Orange in Nancy (France). This combination of industry practitioners, senior researchers, and all the current members of the European research project NL4XAI (Natural Language Technologies for Explainable Artificial Intelligence) will combine their knowledge in using natural language to generate explanations for decisions made by an AI system, which are understandable to non-expert users.</em></p>

        <p>According to EU legislation, humans have a right to explanations of decisions affecting them, when artificial intelligence (AI) based systems make such decisions. However, AI-based systems (which mainly learn automatically from data), often lack the required transparency. Scientists and industry will therefore organize a Spring School as a part of the NL4XAI research project, an initiative funded by the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme in the framework of the European Union’s investment in Explainable Artificial Intelligence.</p>

        <p>Emerging as the <a href="https://nl4xai.eu/">first European Training Network (ETN) on Natural Language (NL) and Explainable AI (XAI)</a>, the project is a joint academic-industry research collaboration that brings together 19 beneficiaries and partners from 6 different European countries, including France, Malta, Poland, Spain, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom. The main goal of this 4-year initiative is to train early-stage researchers (ESRs, in general, Ph.D. students) who face the challenge of designing and implementing a new generation of self-explaining AI systems. The NL4XAI network also facilitates sharing state-of-the-art knowledge on the subject of Explainable AI.</p>

        <p><strong>Tackling inconsistencies</strong></p>

        <p><em>Natural Language Generation</em> (NLG) is an artificial intelligence technique capable of generating text from various types of input, such as numerical data, traces, text, or knowledge bases, and therefore providing a potentially powerful tool to explain the reasoning of AI models. However, the models used in these techniques are not error-free: before they can be used to explain the reasoning of AI models, they need to be further improved. In particular, it must be ensured that the text they generate is faithful to the input, that it covers all information present in the input, and conversely, that it does not contain content that is irrelevant or even contradictory to the input.</p>

        <p>Along with this Spring School, the NL4XAI members will focus on explainable methods for <em>Natural Language Generation</em> (NLG), which aim to detect errors in the output of NLG models in order to explain the sources of these errors. Specifically, they will delve into a series of lectures and a hands-on workshop, being exposed to an in-depth analysis of the types of errors that can be produced by these models. The lectures will provide them with the background necessary to understand neural NLG models and will be given by both industry practitioners (ORANGE Lannion, France; and GOOGLE, London, UK), and senior NL4XAI researchers. In addition, the workshop will allow the ESRs to study the errors made by existing NLG models and reflect on both the implications of such errors and ways of remedying them.</p>

        <p><strong>Fifth pooling of the network</strong></p>

        <p>The NL4XAI has already hosted four training events, including events focused on Ethics/Law in Natural Language Processing, more broad natural language technology, and Interaction/Interfaces. In addition to these official training events, the ESRs have been learning from fellow scientists at different universities and companies. In 2021, we saw fruitful exchanges with the University of Malta, Maastricht University, Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), IIIA-CSIC, and CITIUS-USC. &nbsp;With fewer COVID-19 related travel restrictions in 2022, the ESRs will also be able to visit Utrecht University, the University of Twente, TU Delft, ARG-tech, as well as the companies Orange, Wiznoze, and Info Support.</p>

        <p><strong>H2020 Training Network</strong></p>

        <p>NL4XAI is funded by the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, through a Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant, in the framework of the European Union’s bet for Explainable Artificial Intelligence. The network is coordinated by the research team at the Research Centre in Intelligent Technology of the University of Santiago de Compostela (CiTIUS-USC), headed by Senén Barro. NL4XAI is a joint academic-industry research network, that brings together 18 beneficiaries and partners from six different European countries (France, Malta, Poland, Spain, The Netherlands, and UK). The partners correspond to two national research institutions (<a href="https://www.iiia.csic.es/">IIIA-CSIC</a>, <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a>), ten universities (<a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/">University of Aberdeen</a>, <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/">University of Dundee</a>, <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/">L-Universitá ta’ Malta</a>, <a href="https://tudelft.nl">Delft University of Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>, <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/">University of Twente</a>, <a href="https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw" target="_blank">Warsaw University of Technology</a>, <a href="http://welcome.univ-lorraine.fr/en" target="_blank">Université de Lorraine</a>, <a href="https://www.usc.gal/en" target="_blank">Universidade de Santiago de Compostela</a>, <a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html" target="_blank">Universitat Autonòma de Barcelona</a>) and six private companies (<a href="http://www.indracompany.com/" target="_blank">Indra</a>, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/gb-en" target="_blank">Accenture</a>, <a href="https://www.orange.fr/portail" target="_blank">Orange</a>, <a href="https://www.wizenoze.com/language/en/home/" target="_blank">Wizenoze</a>, <a href="https://www.arria.com/" target="_blank">Arria</a>, <a href="https://www.infosupport.com/en/home/" target="_blank">InfoSupport</a>).</p>

        <p>At TU Delft the ESR Alisa Rieger joined the Web Information Systems group in June. She is working on the mitigation of human bias for users of recommender systems. This will be done by developing a communication layer between XAI systems and humans in form of an interface for interactive explanation generation.</p>

        <p>This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 860621.</p>

        <h1>Natural Language to make Artificial Intelligence self-explaining: the members of the NL4XAI project meet for the first time</h1>

        <p><em>The aim of this four-year European project is to use natural language to generate explanations for decisions made by an AI system, which are understandable to non-expert users. The project members will meet at the 4th of September in Santiago de Compostela, Spain (to the extent this is possible under COVID-19 related restrictions) for the first training event of the network.</em></p>

        <p>According to EU legislation, humans have a right to explanations of those decisions affecting them, even if artificial intelligence (AI) based systems make such decisions; however, AI-based systems (which mainly learn automatically from data), often lack the required transparency. With the aim of contributing to avoid this, scientists work currently on the development of more transparent systems, just as they do along <a href="https://nl4xai.eu/">NL4XAI, the first European Training Network (ETN) on Natural Language (NL) and Explainable AI (XAI)</a>. The main goal of this initiative is to train eleven creative, entrepreneurial and innovative early-stage-researchers (ESRs, in general PhD students with less than 4 years of research experience) who will face the challenge of designing and implementing a new generation of self-explanatory AI systems.</p>

        <p><em>‘NL4XAI’, a new European project focused on Interactive Natural Language Technology for Explainable Artificial Intelligence. / CiTIUS</em></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>NL4XAI includes a broad program of training events and opportunities, ranging from network-wide events, to courses covering technical and scientific domains and transferable skills. The ESRs will receive training in natural language generation and processing, argumentation technology and interactive interfaces for explainable AI (XAI). Additionally, they will receive training in ethical and legal questions of the field and in transdisciplinary skills. Each ESR will work on their individual research project at one of the network’s host-organizations and take part in network wide training events and meetings, as well as in secondments to other beneficiaries or partners.</p>

        <p><strong>Open source framework</strong></p>

        <p>As a result the ESRs will be well prepared to design and build XAI models that generate interactive explanations on the basis of natural language and visual tools which are intuitively understandable by non-expert users, validated by humans in specific use cases and accessible to all European citizens. Main outcomes are to be publicly reported and integrated into a common open source software framework for XAI. In addition, those results to be exploited commercially will be protected through licenses or patents.</p>

        <p><strong>First training event</strong></p>

        <p>One of the first milestones of the NL4XAI project will take place the 4th September 2020 along the Initial Training Meeting, as a part of the NL4XAI Network-wide Training Program (NTP), which is aimed to serve as a point of encounter for all ESRs and supervisors.</p>

        <p>This first meeting will be co-located with the <a href="https://digital.ecai2020.eu/">24th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)</a>, Europe’s premier AI Research venue, also organized by the NL4XAI coordinator, from August 29th to September 8th, 2020. ECAI provides an opportunity for researchers to present and discuss about the best AI research, developments, applications and results. This international event will allow NL4XAI ESRs to meet the community from ECAI, facilitating feedback on ongoing thesis through the participation at the Doctoral Consortium session, and exchanging perspectives with experts.</p>
