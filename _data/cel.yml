  - title: EdX Log-data analysis and Dashboard tool
    description: Learning analytics can support teachers by providing statistics based on the data traces that students generate when interacting with online learning environments. MOOC platforms generate vast amounts of learner data, but it’s the teacher’s responsibility to obtain, prepare and analyse this data. ELAT is a browser-based, local processing tool that attempts to minimize the first two, so teachers and researchers can focus on analysis.

  - title: Formative assessment of computational thinking.
    description: With the vision to further promote CT, in this project, we plan to investigate the importance of CT in Higher Education, explore the relationship between CT skills and programming skills, build a model to formatively assess learners’ CT skills, identify automatable components, develop formative assessment system to enhance students’ CT competences.
